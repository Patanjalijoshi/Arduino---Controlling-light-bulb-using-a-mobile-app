# Arduino---Controlling-light-bulb-using-a-mobile-app
In this project a light bulb will be controlled with the help of a mobile app over a bluetooth connnection

## Controlling-a-light-bulb-using-a-mobile-app
In this project a mobile app is used to send messages to the arduino mega 2560 over a bluetooth connection to toggle a relay on or off. The lightbulbs operationg voltage is 220 volts so a relay is used to control it.



### Components used:
* Arduino Mega 2560 (The code will be compatable with the Arduino uno as well)
* Light bulb 
* HC-05 bluetooth module
* Single channel relay 


### Mobile app:
The mobile app is built using the Mit app inventor
